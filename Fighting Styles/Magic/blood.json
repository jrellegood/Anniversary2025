  "styleDescription": "A dark, sacrifice-based fighting style focusing on converting life force into power. Features risk-reward mechanics, health manipulation, and devastating effects paid for with the caster's vitality.",
  "styleType": "Magical",
  "rangePreference": "Flexible Range",
  "historicalInspiration": "Blood Magic draws from historical hematomancy traditions and vitalist theories documented across multiple cultures. Western influences include John Dee's obscure manuscript 'Liber Sanguinis' (c. 1580s) which detailed blood-based sympathetic magic, and Paracelsus' work on the 'vital humor' in 'Archidoxis Magica' (1575). Eastern influences include the Chinese medical text 'Huangdi Neijing' (黄帝内经, c. 200 BCE) with its detailed understanding of blood circulation and vitality, and the Tibetan 'gsang ba snying thig' (Heart Essence of the Secret) tantric practices involving vital essence manipulation. The Vitality resource mechanic reflects concepts from both the Hermetic 'ensoulment' theories documented in the 'Corpus Hermeticum' and the Japanese concept of 'ketsu-ki' (blood energy) found in medieval medical and martial texts like the 'Tenchi Happo Hoken no Maki' (天地八法宝剣之巻, c. 16th century). The sacrifice mechanics draw from both European blood covenant rituals documented in Heinrich Kramer's 'Malleus Maleficarum' (1486) and Aztec codices describing blood offerings as exchanges of power.",
