# DUAL MASTERY
## Complete Game Rules

### CORE CONCEPT
Dual Mastery is a tactical card game where players combine two different fighting styles to create a unique deck. Players use stance-based combat, resource management, and strategic planning to reduce their opponent's health to zero.

### COMPONENTS
- 6+ style decks (8 cards each)
- Focus dice (d4, d6, d8, d10, d12)
- Environment deck(s)
- Health trackers
- Focus tokens
- Range tracking marker

### GETTING STARTED

#### Setup
1. Each player selects 2 fighting styles (8 cards each) and combines them into a 16-card deck
2. Shuffle your deck and draw 5 cards to form your starting hand
3. Each player starts with 20 health
4. Place the Environment deck facedown nearby
5. Reveal the top card of the Environment deck and apply its effects
6. Determine the first player randomly

#### Game Area
- **Hand**: Cards you can play
- **Focus Area**: Cards placed face-down as resources
- **Stance Area**: Your active stance card (if any)
- **Meditation Zone**: Discard pile
- **Range Track**: Token showing relative positioning (Close or Far Range)

### TURN SEQUENCE

1. **Beginning Phase**
   - Roll for Environment change (5-6 on a d6)
   - Draw a card (maximum hand size is 7)

2. **Focus Phase**
   - You may place any number of cards from your hand face-down in your Focus area
   - Each Focus card has an associated die (d4, d6, d8, d10, d12)

3. **Action Phase**
   - Roll all your Focus dice to generate energy
   - Spend energy to play cards from your hand
   - You may change range once by spending 1 energy (unless modified by card effects)
   - Apply any stance advantages/disadvantages and range modifiers
   - Resolve card effects

4. **End Phase**
   - Used Focus cards go to your Meditation Zone
   - Resolve any "end of turn" effects
   - Play passes to your opponent

### CORE MECHANICS

#### 1. Focus System
- Cards are placed face-down as Focus (resource pool)
- Each Focus card has an associated die (d4, d6, d8, d10, d12)
- During your turn, roll all Focus dice to generate energy
- Energy is spent to play cards from your hand
- Used Focus goes to Meditation (discard pile)

#### 2. Stance Advantage System
- Three stance types: Aggressive (Red), Defensive (Blue), Evasive (Green)
- Rock-paper-scissors relationship:
  - Aggressive has advantage over Evasive
  - Defensive has advantage over Aggressive
  - Evasive has advantage over Defensive
- When attacking with advantage:
  - Deal +1 damage
- When attacking with disadvantage:
  - Opponent draws a card

#### 3. Mastery System
- Cards become more powerful when you focus on a single style
- "Master Effects" trigger when you've played 2+ cards of the same style in a turn
- Creates tension between specializing vs. diversifying

#### 4. Range System
- Two positions: "Close Range" and "Far Range"
- Players are always in one of these positions relative to each other
- Changing range typically requires an action or card effect
- Range specialists get bonuses at their preferred range:
  - Close Range specialists (Longsword, Battle Axe): +1 damage at Close Range
  - Far Range specialists (Bow, Ranged Magic): +1 damage at Far Range
- Some cards specify "Close Range Only" or "Far Range Only"
- Track current range with a token on a simple two-position track

#### 5. Style-Specific Resources
- Certain styles have unique resource mechanics:
  - Battle Axe: Momentum (offensive power building)
  - Water Magic: Flow (energy redirection)
  - Bow: Range positioning (distance management)
  - Other styles: Similar unique mechanics

#### 6. Environment System
- Environment cards affect all players
- Roll a d6 at the beginning of each turn; on a 5-6, change to a new Environment
- Environment effects last until the next Environment change
- Environments modify various game mechanics based on the battlefield conditions

### CARD TYPES
