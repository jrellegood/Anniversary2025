# DUAL MASTERY
## Game Design Summary

### CORE CONCEPT
Dual Mastery is a tactical card game where players combine two different fighting styles to create a unique deck. The game balances strategic depth with accessible gameplay, incorporating elements from historical martial arts and fantasy.

### INSPIRATIONS
- **Fire Emblem**: Weapon triangle advantage system (adapted for stances)
- **Lorcana**: Resource system (adapted into our Focus system)
- **Collectible Card Games**: Deck building with distinct style combinations
- **Historical Martial Arts**: Authentic technique names and concepts
- **Fantasy Literature**: Magical fighting styles and thematic elements

### GAME STRUCTURE

#### Deck Building
- Each player selects 2 fighting styles (8 cards each)
- Combined into a 16-card deck
- Fighting styles include martial disciplines (Longsword, Shortsword & Shield, Battle Axe, Bow) and magical approaches (Fire Magic, Water Magic, etc.)

#### Core Mechanics
1. **Focus System**
   - Cards are placed face-down as Focus (resource pool)
   - Each Focus card has an associated die (d4, d6, d8, d10, d12)
   - Players activate Focus by rolling dice to generate energy
   - Used Focus goes to Meditation (discard pile)

2. **Stance Advantage System**
   - Three stance types: Aggressive (Red), Defensive (Blue), Evasive (Green)
   - Rock-paper-scissors relationship between stances
   - Advantageous attacks deal +1 damage
   - Disadvantageous attacks let opponent draw a card
   - Stance mechanics are primarily found in disciplined martial arts styles

3. **Mastery System**
   - Cards become more powerful when you focus on a single style
   - "Master Effects" trigger when playing multiple cards of the same style
   - Creates tension between specializing vs. diversifying

4. **Environment System**
   - Dynamic battlefields that change conditions
   - Environment cards affect all players
   - Environments can change during the game

#### Game Modes
1. **Competitive Play**
   - Head-to-head duels
   - First to reduce opponent to 0 health wins

2. **Cooperative Trials**
   - Players share a health pool
   - Face automated enemy decks with simple AI
   - Trial cards introduce special conditions
   - Works with the same core mechanics as competitive play
