# DUAL MASTERY: THE BLOODLINE LEGACY
## Complete Game Rules

### CORE CONCEPT
Dual Mastery is a tactical card game where players combine two different fighting styles to create a unique deck. Players use stance-based combat, resource management, and strategic planning to reduce their opponent's health to zero. The Bloodline Legacy variant adds a generational element where fighting styles evolve through succession, with defeated players creating heirs who inherit knowledge while developing their own unique capabilities.

### COMPONENTS
- 6+ style decks (8 cards each)
- Legacy cards for each style (3 cards each)
- Focus dice (d4, d6, d8, d10, d12)
- Health trackers
- Focus tokens
- Range tracking marker
- Bloodline Legacy tracking sheet

### GETTING STARTED

#### Setup
1. Each player selects 2 fighting styles (8 cards each) and combines them into a 16-card deck
2. Shuffle your deck and draw 5 cards to form your starting hand
3. Each player starts with 20 health
4. Determine the first player randomly

#### Game Area
- **Hand**: Cards you can play
- **Focus Area**: Cards placed face-down as resources
- **Stance Area**: Your active stance card (if any)
- **Meditation Zone**: Discard pile
- **Range Track**: Token showing relative positioning (Close or Far Range)
- **Bloodline Record**: Tracks style inheritance and mastery across generations

### TURN SEQUENCE

1. **Beginning Phase**
   - Draw a card (maximum hand size is 7)

2. **Focus Phase**
   - You may place any number of cards from your hand face-down in your Focus area
   - Each Focus card has an associated die (d4, d6, d8, d10, d12)

3. **Action Phase**
   - Roll all your Focus dice to generate energy
   - Spend energy to play cards from your hand
   - You may change range once by spending 1 energy (unless modified by card effects)
   - Apply any stance advantages/disadvantages and range modifiers
   - Resolve card effects

4. **End Phase**
   - Used Focus cards go to your Meditation Zone
   - You may bank up to 2 unused energy as "Focused Energy" for your next turn
   - Resolve any "end of turn" effects
   - Play passes to your opponent

### CORE MECHANICS

#### 1. Focus System
- Cards are placed face-down as Focus (resource pool)
- Each Focus card has an associated die (d4, d6, d8, d10, d12)
- During your turn, roll all Focus dice to generate energy
- Energy is spent to play cards from your hand
- Used Focus goes to Meditation (discard pile)
- You may bank up to 2 unused energy at the end of your turn as "Focused Energy"
- Banked "Focused Energy" can be used on your next turn, but disappears at the end of that turn

#### 2. Stance Advantage System
- Three stance types: Aggressive (Red), Defensive (Blue), Evasive (Green)
- Rock-paper-scissors relationship:
  - Aggressive has advantage over Evasive
  - Defensive has advantage over Aggressive
  - Evasive has advantage over Defensive
- When attacking with advantage:
  - Deal +1 damage
- When attacking with disadvantage:
  - Opponent draws a card

#### 3. Mastery System
- Cards become more powerful when you focus on a single style
- "Master Effects" trigger when you've played 2+ cards of the same style in a turn
- Creates tension between specializing vs. diversifying

#### 4. Range System
- Two positions: "Close Range" and "Far Range"
- Players are always in one of these positions relative to each other
- Changing range typically requires an action or card effect
- Range specialists get bonuses at their preferred range:
  - Close Range specialists (Longsword, Battle Axe): +1 damage at Close Range
  - Far Range specialists (Bow, Ranged Magic): +1 damage at Far Range
- Some cards specify "Close Range Only" or "Far Range Only"
- Track current range with a token on a simple two-position track

#### 5. Style-Specific Resources
- Certain styles have unique resource mechanics:
  - Battle Axe: Momentum (offensive power building)
  - Water Magic: Flow (energy redirection)
  - Blood Magic: Vitality (sacrifice and power)
  - Bow: Range positioning (distance management)
  - Other styles: Similar unique mechanics

### BLOODLINE LEGACY SYSTEM

#### 1. Generational Inheritance
- When a duel ends, the victor becomes the "Champion" and retains both fighting styles
- The defeated player creates an "Heir" character who:
  - Inherits one fighting style from their "parent" (the defeated player chooses which)
  - Must adopt a new fighting style they haven't previously used
  - Challenges the Champion to reclaim family honor

#### 2. Style Mastery
- When a style is passed down for the third consecutive generation, it becomes "Mastered" by that bloodline
- When a style becomes Mastered, the player may replace one card from that style with a Legacy Card
- Each Legacy Card represents both mastery benefits and the toll of aging:
  - Powerful primary effect (the mastery benefit)
  - Drawback effect (the age penalty)
- A player can only have one Legacy Card per Mastered style in their deck

#### 3. Champion's Burden
- After winning 3 consecutive matches, the Champion faces challenges such as:
  - Starting with -2 health in subsequent matches
  - Drawing one fewer card in their starting hand
  - The challenger may view one card in the Champion's hand at the start of the match
- "The weight of the crown brings new challenges..."

#### 4. Bloodline Record
- Track style inheritance across generations
- Record which styles become Mastered
- Document particularly memorable duels and significant events
