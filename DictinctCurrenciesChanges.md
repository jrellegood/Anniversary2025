# Resource Mechanic Revisions

## Battle Axe
Revise Momentum to be a "build-then-crash" system. Momentum accumulates through attacks and stance effects. When Momentum reaches 3+ or higher, it enables powerful bonuses. After using high-Momentum effects, include "Lose all Momentum" clauses. No Momentum gains when not attacking for a turn.

## Water Magic
Transform Flow into a "reaction currency." Flow should only be gained when reducing damage or responding to opponent actions. Add effects that spend Flow to copy or reverse opponent actions. Include card text: "Spend X Flow: Copy/counter the last effect that targeted you."

## Blood Magic
Keep Vitality as a health exchange resource. Emphasize two-way conversion with effects like "Lose X health: Gain X Vitality" and "Spend X Vitality: Prevent X damage." Add cards that let opponents steal Vitality or punish high Vitality accumulation.

## Earth Magic
Make Stability about damage prevention with lasting protection. Add permanent effects while Stability is maintained above thresholds. Include vulnerabilities when Stability is depleted, like "If your Stability is reduced to 0, take 2 damage."

## Fire Magic
Revise Heat to build automatically and become dangerous. Add "Gain 1 Heat at the start of your turn" effects. Include self-damage when Heat exceeds thresholds. Create powerful "cooling" effects that reduce Heat to 0. Make card effects scale with current Heat level.

## Shadow Magic
Transform Shroud into an information warfare resource. Add effects that reveal opponent's hand or deck when spending Shroud. Include "Your opponent can't respond to this card" effects when spending Shroud. Focus less on damage bonuses and more on strategic information.

## Lightning Magic
Make Charge a "build and burst" resource. Add more effects that accumulate Charge gradually but discharge it all at once for powerful effects. Include card text like "If you have 5+ Charge, deal X damage and reduce Charge to 0."

## Arcane Magic
Enhance Mana as a versatile choice resource. Add more "Choose one:" effects when spending Mana. Include energy conversion mechanics like "Convert X Mana to Y energy." Focus on flexibility rather than raw power.

## Quarterstaff
Refine Position as tactical movement advantage. Position should interact with range changes, costing opponents more to change range when you have high Position. Add "Spend X Position: Change range for free" effects.

## Spear
Focus Reach on distance control. Add effects that lock opponents at current range by spending Reach. Make Reach primarily valuable at Far Range with diminishing returns at Close Range.

## Shortsword & Shield
Keep Guard focused on damage prevention with counterattack potential. Add more "Spend X Guard: Reduce damage by X" effects. Include "Spend X Guard: Deal X damage to attacker" to emphasize the offensive use of defense.

## Rapier & Dagger
Make Precision about accuracy and critical strikes. Add effects that ignore defensive abilities when Precision is high. Include combo potential with "If you've dealt damage this turn, gain X Precision."

## Thrown Weapons
Keep Arsenal as a weapon supply resource. Add more specific spending effects like "Spend X Arsenal: This attack deals +X damage" and "Spend X Arsenal: Attack again immediately." Focus on multiple smaller attacks rather than single big ones.
