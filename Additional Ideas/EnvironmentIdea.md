# Environment System in Dual Mastery

## Current Implementation

The Environment system as currently designed in Dual Mastery consists of:

- **Environment deck**: A separate deck of cards representing different battlefields
- **Environment change mechanic**: Players roll a d6 at the beginning of each turn; on a 5-6, a new Environment card is drawn
- **Duration**: Effects last until the next Environment change
- **Universal application**: Effects apply equally to all players
- **Forest environment example**: "Dense woodland that rewards stealth and territorial control"
- **Battlefield modifications**: Environments modify gameplay mechanics like stance costs, damage values, etc.
- **Champion's Burden**: After winning 3 consecutive matches, Champions face increasingly difficult environmental effects

## Forest Environment Card Examples

From the Forest environment deck:

1. **Dense Underbrush**: Aggressive stances cost +1 energy to enter. Players in Evasive stances cannot be targeted by attacks from opponents who changed stance this turn.

2. **Dappled Sunlight**: After playing a card, if it's the first card played this turn, you may roll that card's focus die. On a result of max value, draw a card.

3. **Ancient Roots**: When a player changes stance, they must immediately roll a d6. On a 1-2, they take 1 damage as they trip on hidden roots.

4. **Whispering Leaves**: The first card drawn each turn must be revealed. If it's a stance card, it costs -1 energy to play this turn.

5. **Treacherous Path**: When a player plays an attack card, roll their stance's focus die. If the result is 1, the attack misses and deals no damage.

6. **Natural Shelter**: Players in Defensive stances reduce all damage by an additional 1. Players in Aggressive stances deal -1 damage with attacks.

7. **Forest Spirits**: Magical approach cards cost -1 energy to play. At the end of each turn, each player rolls a d6. On a 1, they lose 1 energy from their focus pool for disturbing the spirits.

8. **Fallen Hollow Log**: Each player may use the effect: 'Once per turn, discard a card to draw a card and gain 1 energy to your focus pool.'
